#### PokÃ©mon Team Builder

A fast, responsive, and fun web app for building your ultimate PokÃ©mon team. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and powered by real-time data from the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/), this project combines performance with interactivity and thoughtful UI design.

###### Overview

This tool allows users to browse PokÃ©mon, view detailed stats and type matchups, and assemble a team of up to 6 PokÃ©mon. Itâ€™s designed as an ongoing project to explore client-side state, data visualization, and PWA patterns in a modern web stack.

> ðŸ’¡ Built as part of my portfolio to showcase frontend skills, API integration, and thoughtful UX.
